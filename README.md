# Purpose

I am using this website to learn more about web programming, managing a continously growing project on github and just for fun.  

## In the works

I finally finished my covid scraping code 3 days before the province of manitoba changed the data they posted...

I must take this intentional and obious slight against the good work i am doing in stride and adapt. 

**New Plan :** Collect urls for all the old postings and either use my old php code or write a new webscraper to collect data on covid #'s and transmission rates in the province. 

That will then allow for some simple data analysis and graphs, likely in python. 

Maybe try and create a API for the data once collected? Good opportunity to explore Flask a bit more.


## Todo

Storing / displaying images in a nice and slightly **secure** way.
  Displaying images hosted on other sites because images can actually be sorta large, and this would be be a convient + something new.
  Galleries feature that displays different galleries. 




anything i can think of that is cool
